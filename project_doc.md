--------------------

### what to do
- N-body simulation of galaxy (2D?)


### how to do
- Take initial condition of N-particles (coordinate and velocity)
- Run gravitational simulation to calculate next position and velocity
- Loop above

- After creating data table (coordinate axis and time axis), show animation



### initial condition
- almost uniform distribution of particles with small random fluctuation of density
- having tangential velocity against single center point (origin)
